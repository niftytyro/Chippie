# Chippie

This is a CHIP-8 interpreter in C (I learned some C _while_ writing this). I wanted to dabble into emulators, and what better place to start than CHIP-8.  

Chippie works prefectly fine with CHIP-8 roms, though there are a few things I wish to do before I can call this finished:

- Adding a _nice_ UI for selecting ROMs and debugging info and such
- Adding nobs for things like adjusting frame rate, toggling clipping/wrapping behavior for display, etc
- Also, probably extending it to cover SCHIP & XO-CHIP (_no promises_)

I will probably touch on those things in the near future. Though for now, I am signing off from this project. But it was certainly very fun!
