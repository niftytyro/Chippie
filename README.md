# Chippie

This is a CHIP-8 interpreter in C (I learned basic C _while_ writing this). I wanted to dabble into animation, and what better start than CHIP-8.  

Chippie works prefectly fine with CHIP-8 roms, though there are a few things I wish to do before I can call this finished:

- Adding a nice UI for selecting ROMs and debugging info
- Adding nobs for adjusting frame rate and toggling things like clipping/wrapping behavior for display
- Probably extending it to cover SCHIP & XO-CHIP etc.

I will probably touch on those things in the near future. But for now, I am signing off from this project. But it was certainly very fun!
